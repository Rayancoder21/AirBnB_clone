## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This project is the foundation for building a comprehensive AirBnB clone application. It provides a command-line interpreter to manage the backend data model, allowing you to create, manipulate, and store data essential for your AirBnB clone.

### Description of the Command Interpreter

The console acts as a command interpreter for managing the core objects within your AirBnB clone. It serves as the interface for interacting with the data model, enabling you to:

- **Create new objects:** Define instances of classes representing elements like users, listings, and reservations.
- **Retrieve objects:** Fetch existing objects from storage for inspection or modification.
- **Perform operations:** Execute actions on objects, such as updating listing availability or managing bookings.
- **Destroy objects:** Remove unnecessary objects from storage when no longer required.

This console serves as a critical tool for setting up and testing the core functionalities of your AirBnB clone before building the full user interface.

### How to Start the Console

To initiate the console, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python, download and install it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command in your terminal to navigate to the directory containing the console script (usually named `console.py`).
3. **Run the script:** Execute the console script using the `python` command followed by the script name, like `python console.py`.

This should launch the console, ready for you to interact with the data model using commands.

### How to Use the Console

The console interacts with you through commands you provide. Here are some fundamental commands to get you started:

- **`create <class_name>`:** Creates a new instance of the specified class (e.g., `User`, `Listing`, `Reservation`). The console generates a unique ID for the object and saves it to storage (typically a JSON file).
- **`show <class_name> [<id>]`:** Displays information about objects of a particular class. If you provide an ID (optional), it retrieves details for that specific object. Otherwise, it showcases all instances of the specified class.
- **`count <class_name>`:** Returns the number of objects belonging to a particular class.
- **`quit` or `exit`:** Terminates the console session.

**Additional commands might be specific to your implementation, so refer to the project's documentation for a complete list.**

### Examples

Here are some illustrative examples of how to use the console commands:

1. Create a new user:
   ```
   create User
   ```

2. Display all users:
   ```
   show User
   ```

3. Create a listing with details (replace placeholders with actual values):
   ```
   create Listing name="Spacious Apartment" city="New York" price=100 description="Modern apartment with stunning views"
   ```

4. Find the total number of listings:
   ```
   count Listing
   ```

Remember, these are just examples. Consult the project's documentation for a comprehensive list of commands and their specific usage within your AirBnB clone implementation.
